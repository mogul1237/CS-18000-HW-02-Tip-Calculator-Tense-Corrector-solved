Goals:
● Familiarity with primitive data types
● Perform arithmetic operations on numeric data
● Manipulate strings using the Java String library
● Getting inputs and printing outputs using Scanner.
Prerequisites:
● Knowledge on string manipulation.
● Knowledge on getting inputs and printing outputs using Scanner.
Description:
For your second homework assignment you are required to write two separate Java
programs, TipCalculator.java and TenseCorrector.java, that will prompt users to
provide certain information which the program will process and produce an output
according to its functions respectively.
1. Task 1: Tip Calculator
2. Task 2: Tense Corrector
Task 1: Tip Calculator
This program uses the Scanner class to prompt users for an amount to be paid by the user in
US dollars (a double) and the percentage of tip the user is willing to give (an int). The
base amount (a double), tip amount alone (a double), and the total amount to be paid (a
double) should then be produced as an output on the console as shown on the example
below. It is important to follow the format closely.
Example/Demonstration:

Price($): 200
Tip Percentage(%): 15
Price Without Tip($): 200.00
Tip Amount($): 30.00
Total Amount($): 230.00
Task 2: Tense Corrector
This program uses the Scanner class to prompt users for a sentence with possible
grammatical errors in it (a String). The program will then manipulate the given string by
replacing all the words in the table below into their past tense. You will only be checked for
the successful conversion of these given words. The “corrected” sentence (a String) will then
be displayed on the console in the next line as shown below.
